### Initialization

All the steps detailed here under initialization needs to be executed only once per project space before you start running the tests.

## Step 1

In the step below you will see a project with name my-element-project is initialized. 

```plain
element init my-element-project
```{{exec}}
__accept all the default value when prompted__


##Step 2##

Update/install all the dependencies, you have to move into the project folder you created in the above step __my-element-project__ to proceed.

```plain
cd my-element-project
```{{exec}}

Run the below command to update/install all the dependencies. 

```plain
cd my-element-project
```{{exec}}

```plain
cd my-element-project
sudo element run --mu /root/script/example1.perf.ts
```{{exec}}


### Running sample script example2.perf.ts##
